<h1>My Hobbies</h1>

<p>I Like routine as much as the next guy, I like my comforts but I also enjoy my adventure every now and again, so here's a list of my favourite things to do:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Reading, mostly novels and fiction but I've also got my work library full of marketing classics</li>
    <li>Walking, on plain mostly I'm not a great fan of hiking on freakin rocky mountains</li>
    <li>Swimming, my element is definely Water, consequently as you've guessed I enojoy Scuba Diving</li>
    <li>Because of the previous things you can Imagine I prefer travelling to warm places with water (I love South East Asia)</li>
    <li>I'd say that's enough sharing, I'm kind reserved, bye MFKS</li>
</ul>
